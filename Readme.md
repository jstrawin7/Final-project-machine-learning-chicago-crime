# Machine learning workflow on Chicago crime dataset.

## Team:

* Divya Vishnumurthy
* Frances Doyle
* Harshavardhan Suresh
* Kevin Kao
* Joe Strawinski
* Ramesh Kalagnanam

## Solution statement goals:
* Define scope (including Data Source)
* Define target performance
* Define context for usage
* Define how solution will be created


## Our solution statement:
Use the machine learning workflow to process and transform Chicago crime dataset to create a prediction model. This model must predict if a crime will result in an arrest with 70% or greater accuracy.

## Data Source
Data is extracted from the Chicago Police Department's Citizen Law Enforcement Analysis and Reporting system
Reported crime between 2001 and present (less the most recent seven days)
As of 10/27/19, 6.9 million records
https://data.cityofchicago.org/Public-Safety/Crimes-2001-to-present/ijzp-q8t2/data


## Algorithms used
 * Random Forest
 * Logistic Regression
 * Decision Tree
 * Naive Bayes
 
## End Result
 * Our model trained on Random Forest predicted arrests with an accuracy of 85%
 * Our model trained on Logistic Regression predicted arrests with an accuracy of 87%
 * Our model trained on Decision Tree arrests with an accuracy of 87%
 * Our model trained on Naive Bayes predicted arrests with an accuracy of 74.2%
